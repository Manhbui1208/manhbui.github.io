## About Me

I'm currently a research associate at the Bio-inspired AI and Robotics (BioRAI) Lab, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with [Asst. Prof. Lin Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SReb2csAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I received my M.Sc. research degree from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia, in early 2025, where I worked under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Hoang Dinh](https://sites.google.com/view/dinh-thai-hoang/) and [Assoc. Prof. Diep Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/view/diep-n-nguyen/). Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Vietnam National University-University of Engineering and Technology (VNU-UET) in 2023. 

## Research Interests

Recently, I've been working on **AI reasoning models based on insights from neuroscience**. During my time at UTS Australia, I focused on Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning using Homomorphic Encryption and Federated Learning to solve privacy problems in networking systems, including IoT and edge computing. Before this, at VNU-UET, I worked on the application of multimodal AI to blockchain security, with a focus on cyberattack detection at both the network layer and bytecode-level of the Ethereum system.
